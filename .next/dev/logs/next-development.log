User Registration \nÔÇ∑ Users enroll their fingerprints through a registration portal (web or mobile). \nÔÇ∑ During registration, each fingerprint is mapped to a unique user ID and linked to \ntheir digital wallet or bank account. \nÔÇ∑ The fingerprint data is securely encrypted and stored on the hosted server, not \nlocally on the device. \n3. Transaction Process \nÔÇ∑ When making a payment, the user places their finger on the fingerprint sensor. \nÔÇ∑ The device captures the fingerprint image and sends it to the hosted server through \na secure API. \nÔÇ∑ The server verifies the fingerprint against the database and authenticates the user. \nÔÇ∑ Upon successful validation, the corresponding amount is deducted from the user‚Äôs \nlinked wallet and credited to the vendor‚Äôs account. \nÔÇ∑ Both the user and vendor receive transaction confirmation details. "," \n4. Security and Data Handling \nÔÇ∑ All data transmission between the device and server is protected using HTTPS \nand SSL encryption. \nÔÇ∑ Fingerprint data is stored only in encrypted format to ensure privacy and \ncompliance with data protection norms. \nÔÇ∑ Server-side JWT-based authentication is implemented to prevent unauthorized \naccess to APIs. \n5. Testing and Evaluation \nÔÇ∑ The system will be tested for accuracy, response time, transaction security, and \nperformance under different network conditions. \nÔÇ∑ Stress tests will be performed to evaluate scalability and reliability when deployed \nacross multiple vendor devices. \n \n \n \n "]

Abstract \n \nDigital payment systems such as UPI, mobile wallets, and card-based transactions have \nsimplified financial transactions but rely heavily on smartphones, internet connectivity, \nand server availability. In emergency situations, such as phone battery depletion, network \ndowntime, or server failures, users often face difficulties in making payments. \n \nThis project proposes a Fingerprint-Based Payment Device that enables users to \nperform secure transactions using only their fingerprint. The device, owned by the \nvendor, is built using a Raspberry Pi 5 and an RS302 fingerprint sensor, and is \nconnected to a hosted cloud server for authentication and payment processing. By \nleveraging biometric verification and secure server-side validation, the system allows \nusers to make payments without cash, cards, or mobile devices, ensuring accessibility, \nreliability, and security even in offline or emergency scenarios. \n \nThe solution is intended for deployment in retail stores, canteens, and low-connectivity \nareas, providing a practical, user-friendly, and scalable alternative to traditional digital \npayment methods. \n \n \n2. Introduction \nThe rapid advancement of digital payment systems has transformed the way financial \ntransactions are carried out. Systems like UPI, Google Pay, and Paytm have made \npayments faster and more convenient. However, these methods depend heavily on \nsmartphones, internet connectivity, and functional servers. In real-world situations such \nas low battery, poor network coverage, or UPI server downtime, users are often unable to \nmake payments creating inconvenience and limiting accessibility. \nTo overcome these limitations, this project introduces a Fingerprint-Based Payment \nDevice that enables secure transactions through biometric authentication. The proposed \ndevice, owned by the vendor, allows users to make payments simply by scanning their \nfingerprint eliminating the need for mobile phones, cash, or cards. The system uses a \nRaspberry Pi 5 integrated with an RS302 fingerprint sensor, connected to a hosted \ncloud server for data verification and transaction processing. \nBy combining the security of biometric authentication with the reliability of server-side \nprocessing, this system aims to provide a fast, accessible, and secure payment \nalternative for both urban and rural environments, especially during emergencies or \nconnectivity is"
